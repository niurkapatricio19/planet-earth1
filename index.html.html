  		    	                    <p>Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet from the sun,</p>
  		    	                    <p>Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life.</p>

                                    <p>With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar systemand it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface.</p>
                                    <p>Water covers roughly 71 percent of Earth's surface, and most of that is in the oceans.About a fifth of Earth's atmosphere consists of oxygen, produced by plants.</p>
                                    <p>While Earth orbits the sun, the planet is simultaneously spinning on an imaginary line called an axis that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole. It takes Earth 23.934 hours to complete rotation on its axis and 365.26 days to complete an orbit around the sun.</p> 
                                    <p>Earth's axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the ecliptic plane, an imaginary surface through the planet's orbit around the sun. This means the Northern and Southern hemispheres will sometimes point toward or away from the sun depending on the time of year, and this changes the amount of light the hemispheres receive, resulting in the seasons.</p>
                                    <p>Earth's atmosphere is roughly 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, with trace amounts of water, argon, carbon dioxide and other gases. Nowhere else in the solar system is there an atmosphere loaded with free oxygen, which is vital to one of the other unique features of Earth: life.</p>

		                    <li>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</li>
                                <p>Reducing your need to buy new products results in a smaller amount of waste. Even if you need to buy, consider buying eco-friendly products. It is the most effective of the three R’s. It simply says cut back from where are you now.</p>
                                <p>Reuse bottles, plastic containers, and other items bought at the grocery store. Reusing water bottles, yogurt cups, bread ties, and other items is being conscious about what is already out there. It will lessen having to purchase other items that would fulfill the same function. Try to use disposable products into some other form. Just don’t throw them away.</p>

                           <li>Bring your own Shopping Bags</li>
                                <p>Plastic bags are destructive to the environment. They take hundreds of years to break down, contaminate soil and waterways, and cause widespread marine animal deaths. Cities and states around the country have enacted plastic-bag bans or charges on single-use bags to combat the problem. Switch to reusable bags and use them consistently to contribute.</p>

                            <li>Turn off Electronic Devices</li>
                                <p>Turn off electronic devices when you are moving out for a couple of days or more. Unnecessary usage of electronic appliances will not only save fuel, i.e., coal by which we get electricity but also increase the useful life of your gadgets.</p>

                            <li>Use Less Hot Water</li>
                                <p>Buy energy saving geysers and dishwasher for your home. Avoid washing clothes in hot water. Just wash them in cold or warm water. Avoid taking frequent showers and use less hot water. It will help in saving the energy required to produce that energy.</p>

                            <li>Use Clean Fuel</li>
                                <p>Electric, smart cars, cars that run on vegetable oil, etc…are great examples of using renewable energy. Supporting companies that provide these products will help the rest of the mainstream manufacturing companies convert over.</p>

                           <li>Save Energy</li>
                                <p>When you consume less, less carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. Setting your thermostat using your smartphone or changing the type of light bulb you use is a great start.</p>
